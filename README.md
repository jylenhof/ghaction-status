# gh-action-pulse

`gh-action-pulse` is a utility designed to monitor and analyze the health of GitHub Actions dependencies within a repository. It scans your workflow and action definition files to identify which actions are being used and provides insights into their versioning status.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Scanning**: Detects `uses:` statements across `.github/workflows` and `.github/actions`.
- **Reference Identification**: Determines if an action is pinned to a specific commit SHA, a tag, or a branch.
- **Update Recommendations**: Queries the GitHub API to compare your current references against the latest stable semantic version (SemVer) tags.
- **Metadata Insights**: Retrieves commit dates and reference types to help evaluate the "freshness" of your CI/CD dependencies.

## Setup

The tool interacts with the GitHub API and requires a GitHub Personal Access Token.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

## Local Installation

```bash
uv tool install . --force --reinstall
```
